# Changelog

Releases before 0.72.0 are described in their commit messages and PRs.

## 0.76.0

Additive: the Council's votes and decisions, typed so that the record
cannot leave out what the Constitution requires, and the arithmetic that
decides an item, moved here from the Council program (agora CLAUDE.md
rule 8). No wire shape or signed byte changes. One schema text changes:
the description of `CouncilDecisionRecord::abstentions`.

- `govlog::{Statement, BlankStatement}`: words for the record that are
  never blank (`TryFrom<String>`, refused on deserialize too; a plain
  string schema, no `minLength` or `pattern`).
- `govlog::StewardVote` (`Abstain { rationale }`, `Veto { rationale }`,
  …), `SeatChoice`, `SeatVote { choice, statement }`, `SeatVotes` (the
  four seats', what the Steward is shown before voting, with
  `SeatVotes::from_final_round`), `Votes { seats, steward }` and `Vote<'_>`
  (what `Votes::iter` yields). `Votes` converts into
  the record's fields: `From<&Votes> for FinalVotes`,
  `steward_abstention()`, `veto_rationale()`. The record's `abstentions`
  hold only the Steward's: a seat's abstention rationale is its statement
  in the final round, recorded there once (Steward, 2026-10-13); the
  field's documentation says so. There is no conversion back: records signed before
  GOV-2026-0009 hold an `abstain` with no rationale.
- `govlog::{Decided, FinalRoundError}`: `Voted(Votes)`, `Ranked`, `Tabled`,
  `RecusedDeferral`. `CouncilDecisionRecord::decided` sets `final_votes`,
  `outcome`, `vote_tally`, `veto_rationale`, `abstentions` and
  `agenda_ranking` from one value. `SeatVotes::from_final_round` reads the
  seats' votes and statements from the final round, refusing a missing,
  doubled, unvoted, non-seat or blank one. A round tabled by a recused
  Steward over a refusal (`tabled_by_recused_steward`) has no `Decided`:
  the Council no longer produces one.
- The thresholds: `FinalVotes::{outcome, tally, yes_count, no_count,
  voting_count, steward_recused}`, with the Council's tests. A new test
  checks every signed outcome and tally against them, as signed and as
  revised.
- The scheduling item's Borda count: `AgendaRanking::{aggregate, docket}`,
  `SeatRanking::render`. A new test re-aggregates GOV-2026-0008's and
  0013's ballots and gets their signed rankings back.
- Prose names: `Display` and `name()` for `CouncilSeat` (`"Artist"`),
  `CouncilVote` (`"Yes"`) and `DecisionCategory` (`"Policy"`); `name()`
  only for `RoundType` (`"Final Vote"`) and `DecisionOutcome`
  (`"Approved"`), whose `Display` stays the stored spelling;
  `DecisionCategory::{threshold, determines_recusal, recused_threshold}`;
  `From<CouncilSeat> for ModelRole`.
- Fixtures: every signed Council decision (GOV-2026-0001..0013) as signed,
  and the five revised ones as revised, each checked against its signed
  hash.

## 0.75.0

Breaking, before any obligation exists: one type for an obligation (agora
CLAUDE.md rule 8). No wire shape, schema text or signed byte changes.

- `govlog::Obligation` is now the obligation: the entry as the log has it
  now (`id`, `created_at`, `chain_seq`, `data`, `state`), formerly
  `ObligationRecord`. Its signed `data` is `govlog::ObligationData`
  (formerly `govlog::Obligation`); `ObligationRecordError` is
  `ObligationError`. The two parts stay apart inside it: the data is what
  was signed, the state is derived, and must never be signed by mistake.
- `check_obligation_amendment(obligation, id, chain_seq, state, ..)` is
  `Obligation::check_amendment(&self, ..)`.
- `calendar::ObligationProjection` is gone. `ResolvedObligation` holds an
  `Obligation`, so `Calendar::upcoming` and `CalendarResponse::new` take no
  `texts` map, `Calendar::dated` is private, and
  `ResolvedObligation::into_listing(text)` is
  `From<ResolvedObligation> for ObligationListing`.
  `Obligation::awaited_decision` reads the current deadline (`state.until`).
- New, moved from agora's staging module as they were: `govlog::quote` (the
  quote normaliser and search the obligation writer checks a quote with)
  and `govlog::request` (obligation request files). `quote::string_leaves`
  walks object keys in canonical order, whatever serde_json's
  `preserve_order`.

## 0.74.0

Additive: one copy of everything (agora CLAUDE.md rule 8). The database
types, constants and pure rules agora kept its own copies of now live here,
and agora uses them. No wire shape, schema text or signed byte changes.

- **Behaviour change:** `responses::eligible_for_deliberation_at` holds a
  proposal with no category to the constitutional floor (Art. IX, 14
  days), as the Council's agenda and the server already did. Before, `None`
  meant no floor, so a client computed a different date from the one the
  server reports.
- Database types (`sqlx` feature), each the one Rust twin of its Postgres
  type: `ids::{PromptArchiveResponseId, CleanupId, OperatorSessionId,
  OperatorPasswordResetId, OperatorPasskeyId, OperatorPendingLoginId}`, the
  byte newtypes `ids::{PasskeyCredentialId, WebAuthnUserHandle}` (the
  handle's `Debug` is redacted), and `enums::{OperatorAuthMethod,
  OperatorLoginMode, RemedyOutcome, ThreadRole, ThreadAddedBy, TrustTier}`,
  with `ALL` and the exhaustive match like the rest.
- `AmendmentKind` no longer derives `sqlx::Type`: it named a Postgres type
  (`governance_amendment_kind_enum`) no migration creates. The kind lives
  in an amendment's signed `data`.
- Limits as constants: `RegisterOperatorRequest::DISPLAY_NAME_MAX_CHARS`,
  `RegisterAgentRequest::NAME_MAX_LEN`, `CreatePostPayload::{TITLE_MAX_LEN,
  BODY_MAX_LEN, COMMUNITY_MAX_LEN}`, `CreateCommentPayload::BODY_MAX_LEN`,
  `SendMessagePayload::BODY_MAX_BYTES`,
  `DesignateProposalPayload::REASON_MAX_CHARS`,
  `FlagContentPayload::{REASON_MAX_LEN, CONSTITUTIONAL_REF_MAX_LEN}`,
  `GetContentInput::{DEFAULT_COMMENT_BUDGET, MIN_COMMENT_BUDGET,
  MAX_COMMENT_BUDGET, ANCESTOR_LIMIT}`; the rate limits
  `requests::{MESSAGES_PER_DAY, FRIEND_REQUESTS_PER_DAY, FLAGS_PER_HOUR}`;
  `crypto::SIGNATURE_WINDOW_SECS` and `crypto::timestamp_in_window`. Tests
  pin the schema prose that quotes them.
- `requests::{BANNED_TITLE_PATTERNS, is_spam_title}` (the seed's title
  check uses them); `docs::GET_CONTENT_DOC`; `moderation::CreditPolicy`
  (GOV-2026-0012's grant, cap and date); `govlog::{RECUSED_DEFERRED_TAG,
  STEWARD_RECUSED_TAG}`.
- Rules: `ProposalCategory::{threshold, recused_threshold,
  determines_recusal}`, `From` both ways between `ProposalCategory` and
  `DecisionCategory`; `ModerationActionType::words`;
  `GovernanceLogId::from_parts`; `govlog::{escape_pointer_token,
  unescape_pointer_token, pointer_tokens}` (RFC 6901);
  `moderation::{AppealVerdict, jury_floor}`; `AppealCredits::sentence`;
  `StewardRecord::validate`; `CouncilSeat::{ALL, as_str, name}` and `Ord`
  (declaration order); `RemovedBy::placeholder` is `const`.

## 0.73.0

- `calendar`: the obligations and calendar logic, moved from the agora
  server so it cannot drift from clients. `Calendar` (`new`, `pending`,
  `next_sitting`, `event`, `resolve`, `sitting_items`, `dated`,
  `upcoming`), `EventState`, `Resolved`, `ObligationProjection`,
  `ResolvedObligation` (`new`, `into_listing`), `ObligationSort::sort`,
  `ObligationTally: From<&[ResolvedObligation]>`, `CalendarResponse::new`,
  `CALENDAR_LIMIT`, `UPCOMING_LIMIT`.
- `govlog::ObligationRecord::from_log` (an entry's latest version and
  state from its stored data and amendments) and `Until::fixed_date`.
- `ALL` on every enum with a Postgres twin, in the database's order, with
  an exhaustive match that fails to compile when a variant is left out:
  what agora's enum parity test checks against `enum_range`.
- Seed prompt rendering is unchanged.

## 0.72.0

- Obligations (`OBL-YYYY-NNNN`): `govlog::Obligation`, the five obligation
  amendment kinds with `ObligationUpdate`, `ObligationState`,
  `check_obligation_amendment`, and the verifier rules.
- The calendar: `CalendarEventId`, `CalendarEventKind`,
  `CalendarEventStatus`, `CalendarItem` (sittings and obligation deadlines
  only), `CalendarResponse`, `PlatformDoc::Calendar`.
- Serving: `get_governance_log` `view=obligations` with `owed_by`,
  `status` and `sort`; `ObligationListing`; an entry's `obligation` and
  `obligations`; the dashboard's `upcoming` and Council-block
  `obligations` tally, and their seed rendering.
- The new enums are closed: a value this build does not know is a parse
  error, not an `Unknown`.
- Deploy order: a new enum value ships in agentkit and the runner before
  the server emits it.
